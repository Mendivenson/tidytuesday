# TidyTuesday

This repository collects my weekly contributions to the **#TidyTuesday** data visualization challenge created entirely with **base R**.

The main goal of this project is to explore how far R’s native plotting system can go in the art of data storytelling. Instead of relying on `ggplot2` or other visualization packages, each graphic is crafted solely with R’s built-in tools, blending data, design, and creativity within a single frame.

Beyond the technical challenge, this project is also a personal journey to **improve my storytelling skills** by learning how to communicate insights through **simple, clear, and visually appealing graphics**. Each visualization seeks to balance clarity and aesthetics.

This repository contains the code used to generate each weekly visualization. Rather than providing long explanations or written summaries, the main insights and conclusions are embedded directly within the graphics — making every plot a self-contained piece of visual communication.

## Last Week’s Challenge

The **Statistical Performance Indicator** dataset was quite straightforward to work with, as the data was clean and well-curated. However, creating meaningful visualizations proved challenging because it was important to preserve the **time-organized** nature of the data while also addressing its high level of **dispersion**.\
Last week’s visualizations focused on achieving a clear and balanced understanding of the data without losing its temporal dimension, aiming to represent both variability and trend in a coherent and visually appealing way.

Yeah, I'm aware that the font and ratio between plot-text is not the most optimal but it was too late to fix it :'c
