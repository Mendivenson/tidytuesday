# Notes on Implementation: What is being plotted? What could be done differently?

-   **Week 48: Statistical Performance Indicators**

For each country, the World Bank calculates a *Statistical Performance Indicator (SPI)* that represents the nation’s data capabilities. The index is composed of five pillars: (i) data use, (ii) data services, (iii) data products, (iv) data sources, and (v) data infrastructure.\
However, not all pillars have been measured since 2004, which makes creating consistent and comparable visualizations more challenging.

While reviewing the final "poster", it seems that the visual components lose some of their impact because the explanatory text is much larger than the plot labels and graphics themselves. In the future, it might be better to define the final file’s aspect ratio first, and then design the individual plots accordingly to avoid layout distortion across formats.\
Additionally, the distribution of countries by income plot doesn’t feel strictly necessary — I included it mainly to fill a visual gap rather than to add meaningful insight.

Please, use the par function to avoid write the same thing over and over again D:
